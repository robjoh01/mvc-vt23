==================

This repository contains the PHP Symfony project developed as part of the [MVC](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/mvc-v2) (Model-View-Controller) course offered by [BTH School](https://www.bth.se/). The project focuses on building a web application using the Symfony framework, implementing the MVC architectural pattern.

The project showcases best practices for building robust and maintainable PHP web applications using Symfony's powerful features, such as routing, controllers, models, views, and database integration. It demonstrates the separation of concerns between the different components of the application and emphasizes code organization, reusability, and extensibility.

## Getting started

To clone and get started with the project, follow these steps:

* Make sure you have PHP and Composer installed on your local machine.
* Clone the repository using the following command

`git clone git@github.com:robjoh01/mvc-vt23.git`

* Navigate to the project directory
* Install the project dependencies using Composer
* Set up the database configuration in the `.env` file.
* Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables
* Start the local development server using the following command 

`php -S localhost:8888 -t public`

* Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:8000.
